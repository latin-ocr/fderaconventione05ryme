ITEM, if that other Partie wol nat Contente hem with the

Title and Claime os the Coronne of France, betwix the Princes
that have strived thereupon ‚have endured this Hundred Yere and
more: And that there haan be moo Men ssayne, in the Conti-
nuance of hem , of 00 Ν361011 and other , tnan ben at this
day in bothe Landys , and so much Christien Blode 1116-
de 3 that it is to grete a Sorow and an Orrour to Thinke
or Here it3 Addyng that, in al the Erthe Cristyn and Hethyn‚
be not so mony Noble Princes, Knightes‚ and Squires, and
Men of Fete , as hay perished in the same-&Verres3 by force of
whiche Men , and they ne had be so labored and consumed in
the sa'd VVerres, the' Cristen Faith and Beleve, the whiche is
now so gretl lasl'ed and decressed as it is wele knowe, and the
Remes and mre, *thet had received in and were grounded in
the same, now pervertid , mi ht and ssrold not oonly have be
defendid and kep‘t, but the sii Cristen Feith and Beleve had,
by lyklyhode of reson, be dilated thorgh the World: So that this
1' orous and extreme continuance and abiding upon the said
Cayms and Querele on bothe fids bath, by Manne's probable
Confideracion, be and is the cause as wele of the said sorowful
diminucion· and decresse of the said Cristene Beleve, as of the
le ng of th²encoesse and dilatacion therof , and so be cause
ogerdicion noght oonly of th' innumerable Menne’s Bodys
that 113311 peussxed by th'abuse of the Werre , and of the
W'retchedneffe and Synne that hath enssred thereof, but also of
infinite other vMenne’s Soules, that shold noght have perished ‚but
be saved by the mene of continuance and dilatacion of the Cristen

Beleve, if this obstinacie had ῃῗὴῑ be3 of the whiche Soulesjch
was more procidus thanne al th’ rth

W rTn this the said Ptine& may be meved to confidre, that
either-this werre must 611616 endure and nevere bave ende, that

PUBLICA.

ΑΜοΝ G other things is , that owe to meve the Princes to
desire that it so do, oon grete thing is the confideracion of the
N yghnesse of Blode, that they stande inne ich of hem to other,
and ich of hem to al the grete Princes of bothe Lands, for the
whiche cause theim owid , by the Lawe of God and Nature,
and by the Ordre of Charite , 1611 of theim to defire and wille
the good of other, and to peine hem to th'Appesement of thise
{Ignes that be so detestable and contraire to Nature and to al

on.

ΑΝ 1), ον61 this, the Princes of bothe Parties owe to confi-
1116 11131 God made noght his People in the said Two Remes net
10 011161 for the princes, but He made the Princes for his Servi-
ce and for the W'hele and Behove of his People (that is to stay)
to Reule theim in Tranquillite (namly) by the mene of deue Mi-
mstracton oiJustice: So that they, so Reuled , 11131 mowe 16111111-
ly and pffifible serve hym, the whiche thise Werres suffn'th hem
noght, ne shal suffre 11601, but lette 11610 10 (100, whiles they con
nnuc and endure.

And by thise Mammas, and other suche as my seid Lords the
Caramales great Wisdom wol avise , he 11131 mawe Exhorte and
St1re both Princes to lyfft upon Confideracions and her sight to
God, and to shwe the Tenderneffe and the Zele that they bere
to the Savacion and· Eschuyng of Dampnacion of Menny’s Sou-
165, and to the Relref Exaltacion of the Cristen Feith and Bele-
ve : Also to {hewe the love that they, as Cristen princes, have
and bere to tho that be hir Subgetz and other that be Christen
Men , the whiche by the Lawe of God them owed tenderly and
brotherly to love: to ssiew also, noght in VVords oonl and Wri-

hem to prefer so grete Goods, and th‘Eschuyng of so grete and
innumerable Mischiefs and InconvenienceS, biforethe Rigour and
Hardneffe of her propre Entents and Desires.

Ovs R this, the said Princes may be meved to confidre that
the principal cause, that lhould meve any of hem to desire the'
said Coronne of France, ihold be noght Ambition of Worldly
Wonhip, ner Covetise of Errhly Dominacion and Richeffe, but
the Service that he sholde entende to do to God in Governance
of his People in the said Reme:

And , with this, to confidre that the Cuntre,compriffed within
